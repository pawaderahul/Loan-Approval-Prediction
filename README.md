## Framing ProblemÂ¶
      For now, we can categorize our Machine Learning System as:
          1. Supervised Learning Task- we are given labled training data(e.g. we alredy know some of the Loan_status)
          2. Classification task- our model is expected to predict the Loan_status using given features.
